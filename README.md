Movie-Genre-Classification :
This project tackles the task of movie genre classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the genre of a movie based on its title and description. The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing steps like handling missing values, removing noise, and translating non-English descriptions. After preprocessing, features are extracted from the text using TF-IDF vectorization. The dataset is then balanced to address class imbalance. Finally, various classification models are trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to determine the best performing model for accurate genre prediction.
