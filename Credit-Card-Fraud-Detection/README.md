Credit card fraud detection:
This a machine learning project that aims to identify fraudulent transactions using historical data. 
This data typically includes details about past purchases, such as amount, location, and time. 
By analyzing this data, the model can learn the spending patterns of individual cardholders.
When a new transaction deviates significantly from these patterns (e.g., large purchase overseas), the model can flag it as potentially fraudulent.
However, a key challenge is that fraudulent transactions are much rarer than legitimate ones. 
To address this imbalance, I employ techniques like oversampling (replicating legitimate transactions) or undersampling (reducing fraudulent transactions) to ensure the model trains effectively on both types.

Overall, credit card fraud detection with machine learning helps financial institutions protect their customers and reduce financial losses.
